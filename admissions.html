      <h1>ADMISSIONS</h1>
     </br>
      <h2>Registration to Talent Based Learning(TBL)</h2></br>
      <p>
        There are THREE STEPS (and in order!) for admission under the GATES Education Model:
      </p>

      <h4>1. Through Inherent potentials unveiled through Gift and Talent Testing</h4>
      <p>
        Whereas most institutions attach a lot of significance to grades on papers earned through qualifications, we consider grades as just mere guides. We already know that grades can be very misleading as many candidates panic in examinations, which has nothing to do with inherent ability of candidates. How about if the candidate’s parents perished in a road accident and the candidate was psychologically affected and could not revise nor concentrate in exams, yet he/she has always been a top student? How about is the candidate fell sick 2 months to exams and had to write the exams from a hospital bed? In all these cases, would grades be a true reflection of the candidate’s real ability. The true ability of the candidate can be known through a process known as Gift and Talent Testing. This process finds out the candidate’s ability MINUS grades and related written exam factors.

      </p>
      <h4>2. Through work or research-based experience</h4>
      <p>
        There many cases where adults wish to get back to college or university to “add a new cap to my success in the work place or business”. So they make long queues with age-mates of their children to enquire and hope to be admitted. They are usually disappointed as they are reminded of their low grades more than 10-20 years ago and no one cares about the short term courses, workshops attended and presented at, board meetings chaired, recognitions and achievement awards, etc.

      </p>
      <p>
        In many cases the rigid admission processes in most of our institutions remind them that their grades are low and that they could start from bridging levels. Do you believe that the Managing Director of a successful bank (with grade D acquired 10 years ago) should start at the same level with fresh O or A Level student with grade A? Of course no! That’s where Accreditation for Prior Experiential Learning (APEL) comes in. The system allows career experts to evaluate your work experience and produce a portfolio of your knowledge. With the portfolio, academic credit points can be determined and these are used to earn you uniform exemptions hence able you to start directly at 2nd or 3 rd year.

      </p>
      <p>
        The process has always been used and some of the candidates have been only required to write specialization paper (also known as thesis) within 1-3 months and got their bachelors or masters degrees. In other cases, and where combined with qualifications, the same has been used for those with higher potentials, and without formal education, to get doctorate degrees directly. Accreditation for Prior Experiential Learning (APEL) is part of the Talent Based Learning and is the main source of Mature Talent used for the Learning of the Veterans.

      <h4>3. Through acquired qualifications</h4>
      <p>
        Qualifications or grades are the last items we look at during admissions after considering inherent potentials through Gifts and Talents OR Work /Life/Research-based experience. Based on qualifications, a candidate can get direct admission to a Talent Based course level and can also earn direct exemptions, but ONLY AFTER a Professional Assessment for Gift and Talent Testing to unearth true potentials in terms of talent focus.

    </p></br>
      <h4>The Career Chart outlines the stages and awards at each stage of achievement</h4>
      <p>
        The Career Chart shows FOUR main levels of Achievement and each level equates to a diploma or bachelors or masters degree. However, the learning is not constructed on the basis of academics but on the basis of talent. Those with academic qualifications can also be accepted on the basis of academic clinic quotients. So, it is possible that one started from academics without knowing his/her talent. But once the talent is known the person may now work on the Talent Based Learning System and use the gained knowledge to accelerate and begin at a higher level. The Blended Learning (Christopher Bayer, Ph.D.Psychologist & Psychoanalyst NYU Postdoctoral Psychology Program, 1982) provides an enriched learning environment whose result is a pioneer , inventor or a child prodigy with the capacity to bring total revolution to a sector.
