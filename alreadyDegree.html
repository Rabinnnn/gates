      <h1>Already Have Degrees And Wish To Further Their Education</h1>
      <p >
      Imagine there is a guy who completed a Bachelors of Commerce (B.Com) degree 24 years ago and did not further his education because a job was available and he needed to work and build his family first.
      </p></br>

      <p>
        Now, after the 24 years, he is the branch manager of a major bank and wishes to undertake a masters degree in Banking and Financial Services.
      </p>
        <p>
          Another young man equally completed his bachelors degree in B.Com and obtained a first class honours 6 months ago and with totally no experience but has been sponsored , in the form of scholarships, to undertake the same Masters degree in Banking and Financial Services.
        </p>
        <p>Do you think, these two are the same and can be in the same class, taught the same way?</p>
        <p>No, the one with experience is way ahead and can even teach the young man and it will be a disaster to keep them in the class. The experienced one has real-world knowledge and it is wrong to repeat for him what he already knows!</p>
        <p>However, most African universities will still admit them just based on grades without caring about the experiential knowledge the adult already has.</p>
        <p>
          This is where MATRIIC Professional & Scientific Evaluation of Life and Work Experience become important for the experienced banker. He will be evaluated for his Life/Work Experience and his prior knowledge unearthed in the form of Prior Credits.  These prior credits will earn him exemptions and probably eliminate the need for coursework. His course duration will then be significantly short and he will pay less hence meeting his expectations equally sooner and in a more dignified manner (i.e. without the need to sit the same class with children the age of his own and related headaches of attending class).
        </p>
        <p>
          Using MATRIIC Engines under “Reverse Engineering” , the adult can be able to know his natural abilities (Talent) that could have been mismatched or lost in the early days. This MATRIIC Engine is able to produce the career of the adult when he was 8-10 years old and this is very critical in determining “the next business to invest in’ since you can only invest in what is naturally you to have a high chance of success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many successful adults have used this modern technology (MATRIIC Engines) to ensure that they do not make wrong investment and squander earnings from their previous businesses. It is also important for those who wish to start businesses having saved during employment.
