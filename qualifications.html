      <h1>For Those Who Have Some Qualifications But No Degree</h1>
      <p >
        There are a number of people who did not meet the required “cut-off” points to join a medical or engineering degree or related due to a number of factors.
         These factors may include:
      </p></br>
    <ul>
      <li>Poverty leading to lack of food, shelter and fees</li>
      <li>Harsh learning environment that requires them to travel long distances in pursuit of education, and without adequate or appropriate learning resources</li>
      <li>Early and unexpected pregnancies, or sickness that hinders ability to learn effectively</li>
      <li>Family troubles, lack of guidance and associated behavioral issues.</li>
      <li>Inability to understand some subjects e.g. Mathematics and Sciences hence falling out with teachers</li>
      <li>Having non-academic talent hence regarded as a academic failure e.g being good in sports but schools are concentrating in academics</li>
      <li>Natural learning challenges e.g timidity leading to panic in examinations, inability to memorize or cram notes effectively , clinical or medical challenges, etc</li>

    </ul>
    </br>
      <p>
        However, some of them felt they really had the talent to succeed in these careers and found means to join certificate and / or later, diploma level qualifications through other technical institutions.

Some of them have emerged with amazing success. They have become the innovators or the ones much-sought for amazing human skills. They are the ones who re-train the graduates from the universities but ‘cannot rise to be their bosses since they do not have degrees’.

Much as they perform very well, their career growth in places of work is limited by lack of a university degree and thus may wish to access further education so that they can improve in their roles and at the same time gain respect for academic achievement.

Often they would approach established academic institutions who have set admission criteria that would make them start from low levels hence a number years in university, learning with children the age of their own!

      </p></br>
              <h5 style="color:orange;">The Matriculation Process</h5></br>
        <p>Matriculation is the process of evaluating the learning content and experience of an adult learner and how the knowledge possessed can be used to link up with either academic or professional intellectual capacity in the shortest possible period .

There are 4 Levels of Matriculation addressing the needs of the adult learners based on their current levels of education, life and work experience, which must not be less than 5 years.

</br>The matriculation process consists of:</p></br>
<ul>
  <li>Mature Talent Evaluation, Accreditation and Admission</li>
  <li>Life and Work Experience Evaluation & Accreditation and Admission</li>
  <li>Facilitative Learning to address skills gaps and intellectual demand by undertaking an overarching science project relevant to your field</li>
  <li>Credit Transfer to bachelors degree on successful completion of project , depending on background achievement and years of life or work experience</li>
</ul>
</br>
<p>All universities must be accredited and listed by UNESCO in order to be recommended by the council. This ensures that only credible universities are involved as a university in the UNESCO List of Internationally Recognized Universities must be approved and recognized in host country and commonwealth.

At the time of admission you will be presented with at least 3 or 4 universities on this list and you will have the choice of background check and also decide based on process convenience, duration and fees charged.</p></br>
<h5 style="color:orange;">How long will it take?</h5>
<p>The duration of Credit Transfer to the degree depends on your current background (academic, and life/work experience) which are evidenced in the matriculation process. It further depends on how long you will take to complete the project task given.

However, candidates with higher diplomas and at least 7 years of work or life experience usually take 3-4months only to complete the project and transfer credits to full degree. The usual maximum duration is 12 months.</p></br>
<h5 style="color:orange;">How much will it cost?</h5>
<p>The cost depends on the university ranking and reputation. A descent university would cost USD 5400 on the average while the cheapest would cost about USD 3,000 on the average while top ranking universities would cost more than USD 60,000 and are only affordable via scholarships.

Individual university fees will be provided after the matriculation process and specific university involvement.</p></br>
<h5 style="color:orange;">Am I required to travel out of my country? Will I need to pay more?</h5>
<p>In most cases this is a mere upgrade and DOES NOT require candidates to travel out of their home country unless it is a special sponsored scientific research that would need direct involvement with key faculty members for a period exceeding 30 days. If the latter is the case, it is usually sponsored.</p>
